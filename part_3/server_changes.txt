1. I added a new chat type called GUIDANCE that handles conversations that are more instructional, 
helping users navigate through a series of steps or providing personalized advice.

2. I decided that GuidanceChat can use gemma2 since that seemed to provide more instructional
over Llama3.1. It was also much friendlier than Llama3.1

3. The chatbout will route messages that require more instructions or start with a prompt like how
or what instructions.
